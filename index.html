          <li>
            The software doesn’t do something that the product specification says it should do.

            The software does something that the product specifications says it shouldn’t do.

            The software doesn’t do something that the product specification doesn’t mention but should.
          </li>
          <li>
            The software is difficult to understand, hard to use, slow, or in the software tester’s eyes – will be viewed by the end user as just not right.

          What make a Good Software Tester?
        </h3>
        <div class="message-body">
          <p><Strong>
            List of traits that most software testers should have:
          </Strong></p>
          <li>
            They are explorers
            <ul>
              <li>
                Software testers aren’t afraid to venture into unknown situations. They love to get a new piece of software, install it on their PC, and see what happens.
              </li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              They are troubleshooters
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Software testers are good at figuring out why something doesn’t work. They love puzzles.
                </li></ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                They are relentless
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Software testers keep trying. They may see a bug that quickly vanishes or it difficult to re-create. Rather than dismiss it as a fluke, they will try every way possible to find it.
                  </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  They are Creative
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Testing the obvious isn’t sufficient for software testers. Their job is to think up creative and even off-the-wall approaches to find bugs.
                    </li></ul>

                      State Testing

                        State testing is concerned with verifying the programs logic flow through its various states.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A software state is a condition or mode the software is currently in.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Testing the software state and logic flow has the same problems as data testing . It is usually possible to visit all state (if you can’t get to them why have them).
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The difficulty is that except in small programs it is often impossible to traverse all paths to all states.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        This is as a result of a software complexity, especially the richness of today user interface, provides so many choices and options that the number of paths grows exponentially.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The solution is to apply equivalence partitioning techniques to the selection of states and paths to test, assuming some risk because you will choose not to test all the states, but reduce the risk by making intelligent choices.

                      State Testing: Create a State Transition Map (DRAW DIAGRAM)

                        The first step is to create a state transition map of the software. Such a map may be provided with the specification. if it is, you should statistically test it with techniques described in the previous chapter. If you don’t create a state map
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        There are different diagramming techniques for state transition. The technique is not important as long as other member of your project team can understand it

          Examining the Code
        </h3>
        <div class="message-body">
          <p><Strong>
            1. Name several advantages to performing static white-box testing.
          </Strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Static white-box testing finds bugs early in the development cycle, making them less time-consuming and less costly to fix. The software testers can gain information about how the software works, what potential weaknesses and risky areas exist, and can build a better working relationship with the programmers. Project status can be communicated to all team members who participate in the testing.
              </li></ul>
            
           <p><Strong>
            2. True of False: Static white-box testing can find missing items as well as problems.
          </Strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                True. Missing items are arguably more improtant than normal problems and can be found through static white-box testing. When the code is checked against published standards and guidelines and carefully analyzed in formal reviews, missing items become obvious.
              </li></ul>
            
            <p><Strong>
            3. What key element makes formal reviews work?
          </Strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Process. Having a process that's followed is what makes difference between a formal review and two pal programmers glancing over each other's code.
              </li></ul>
            
            <p><Strong>
            4. Besides being more formal, what's the big difference between inspections and other types of reviews?
          </Strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The key difference is that with inspections, a person other than the original author of the code is the presenter. This obiliges another person to fully understand the software being inspected. It's much more effective than having others simply review the software for bugs.
              </li></ul>
            
            <p><Strong>
            5. If a programmer was told that he could name his variables with only eight characters and the first character had to be capitalized, would that be a standard or a guideline?
          </Strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                That would be a standard. If he was told that a name of more than eight characters was preferred, that would be a guideline.
              </li></ul>

            <p><Strong>
            6. Should you adopt the code review checklist from this chapter as your team's standard to verify its code?
          </Strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                No! It's provided as a generic example only. There are some good test cases in it that you should consider when you test your code, but you shuold research and read about other published standards before adopting your own.
              </li></ul>

            <p><Strong>
            7. A common security issue known as a buffer overrun is in a class of errors know as what? They are caused by what?
          </Strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Data Reference. They are caused by using variables, constants, arrays, strings, or records that aren't properly declared or initialized for the data that they can contain.
              </li></ul>
